*Introspection: Powers, Perils, and Practice*
By deeply listening to your own self, that is, observing, evaluating, and describing your own experiences, you can make rapid, decisive judgments about what is and is not working in your game, and why it is or is not working.

Socrates, noted that when we learn something new, it often feels like we knew it all along, and that in learning it, it feels as if we were just reminded of something we already knew, but had forgotten 
But Socrates then goes too far and forms an elaborate argument that since learning can feel like recollection, we must then be reincarnated souls who are just now remembering what we learned in past lives.
**This is the problem with drawing conclusions about reality based on introspection — just because something feels true, it doesn’t mean it is true**


# What Is True of My Experiences May Not be True for Others

“I only design for people like me“

''Personal opinions can’t be trusted ”

Introspection for game design is a process of not just listening to yourself, but also of listening to others. By observing your own experiences, and then observing others, and trying to put yourself in their place, you start to develop a picture of how your experiences differ from theirs.
